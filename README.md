# SpamFilter-ChromeExtension

### Spam detection 
Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering. They typically use bag of words features to identify spam e-mail, an approach commonly used in text classification.

Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam. [More]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering
